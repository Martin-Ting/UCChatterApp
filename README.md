UCR-ChatterApp
==============
This application was developed for CS166 Database Management Systems.

Overview
==============
The motivation for this project was to apply the knowledge learned in CS166 to create a database system for a chat application. I created this Android application as a different way to interact with the database because I found that the command line application required for the project did not provide the same user experience as a mobile application would.
